List of considerations:

### Backend:
1. **Data Structure and Business Logic:**
   - Develop complex data structures and business logic.

2. **API Development:**
   - Define well-structured APIs for frontend communication.

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - Address security concerns, implement authentication, and set up authorization logic.

4. **Database Setup:**
   - Establish database schema and connections.

### Frontend:
1. **User Interface Design:**
   - Focus on designing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

2. **User Feedback and Iteration:**
   - Gather user feedback early for design and user experience improvements.

3. **Prototyping:**
   - Create visual representations and prototypes for design validation.

4. **Parallel Development:**
   - Allow for concurrent development, especially if you have a team with both frontend and backend developers.

### Considerations for Both:
1. **Project Complexity:**
   - Assess the overall complexity of the project and consider concurrent development for less interdependent components.

2. **Technology Stack:**
   - Consider the technology stack and its influence on the development flow.

3. **Team Expertise:**
   - Leverage the strengths of your development team, whether they are specialized in frontend or backend.

4. **Prototyping vs. Data Structure:**
   - Decide whether to focus initially on prototyping and user interactions or on establishing a robust data structure and backend logic.

5. **Project Goals:**
   - Align your decision with the specific goals and requirements of the project.

6. **Iterative Development:**
   - Consider an iterative development approach that involves cycles of frontend and backend development.
