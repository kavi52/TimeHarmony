Basic data structure and business logic:

### Data Structure:

#### 1. User:
- **Attributes:**
  - `userId` (Unique identifier)
  - `username`
  - `email`
  - `password` (Hashed and salted)
  - `role` (Admin, Manager, Employee)

#### 2. Employee:
- **Attributes:**
  - `employeeId` (Unique identifier)
  - `firstName`
  - `lastName`
  - `email`
  - `phoneNumber`
  - `department`
  - `position`

#### 3. LeaveRequest:
- **Attributes:**
  - `leaveRequestId` (Unique identifier)
  - `employeeId` (Reference to the employee)
  - `leaveType` (Sick leave, Vacation, etc.)
  - `startDate`
  - `endDate`
  - `reason`
  - `status` (Pending, Approved, Rejected)

#### 4. AttendanceRecord:
- **Attributes:**
  - `attendanceRecordId` (Unique identifier)
  - `employeeId` (Reference to the employee)
  - `checkInTime`
  - `checkOutTime`
  - `date`

### Business Logic:

#### 1. Authentication and Authorization:
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization using JWT.
- Ensure that certain actions are restricted based on the user's role (Admin, Manager, Employee).

#### 2. Employee Management:
- Allow CRUD operations for managing employee details.
- Implement validation checks for ensuring data integrity (e.g., unique email addresses).

#### 3. Leave Management:
- Handle leave request submissions, approvals, and rejections.
- Update leave balances based on approved leave requests.
- Send notifications to relevant parties on leave request status changes.

#### 4. Attendance Tracking:
- Record check-in and check-out times for employees.
- Calculate attendance metrics and generate reports.
- Provide manual entry options for tracking attendance.

#### 5. Reporting and Analytics:
- Create APIs for generating various reports, such as attendance trends and leave utilization.
- Implement analytics for insights into workforce management.

#### 6. Calendar Integration (Optional):
- Integrate with calendar applications for a unified view of leave schedules and important dates.

#### 7. Notifications:
- Send notifications for upcoming leave periods, leave request status updates, and other important events.

#### 8. Audit Trail:
- Maintain an audit trail to log significant activities, such as leave requests, approvals, and system modifications.

#### 9. Permissions and Roles:
- Define and enforce role-based access control to restrict access to certain features or data.
